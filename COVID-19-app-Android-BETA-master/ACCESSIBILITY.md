Accessibility statement for the NHS COVID-19 App

This accessibility statement explains how accessible the NHS COVID-19 App is, what to do if you have difficulty using it and how to report accessibility problems with the service.


## Using this service

The NHS COVID-19 App is run by NHSX. We want as many people as possible to be able to use the app.

The NHS COVID-19 App is a native app built for Apple iOS and Android devices. Which means you can use the built-in accessibility settings linked below:


*   [Apple iOS accessibility settings](https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/iphone/)
*   [Android accessibility settings](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006564?hl=en-GB)

We've made the text in the NHS COVID-19 App as simple as possible to understand.

If you have a disability, [AbilityNet has advice to help you make your device easier to use](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/).


## Accessibility level of the NHS COVID-19 app

This service is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

*   You cannot change the text size in some parts of the app
*   You cannot phone directly from the app to order a test kit on an iOS device (Apple)
*   The text will not wrap in a single column when you use larger text on an iOS device (Apple) 
*   Some of the link areas, for example the information icon,  are hard to press because they are very small 


## What to do if you have difficulty using the NHS COVID-19 App

If you need information about the NHS COVID-19 App in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or Braille:

*   email: NHSCovid-19AccessibilityIssue@nhsbsa.nhs.uk

We’ll consider your request and get back to you as soon as we can.

## Technical information about the NHS COVID-19 App’s accessibility

NHSX is committed to making the NHS COVID-19 app accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

The NHS COVID-19 App is a native app for Apple iOS and Android devices and it is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), due to the non-compliances listed below.


## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations



*   You cannot change the font size in some parts of the app. This does not meet WCAG 2.1, 1.4.4 - AA (Resize Text). We plan to fix this by the next release of the app. 
*   When using smart invert, several buttons and form elements are not easily perceivable. This does not meet WCAG 2.1, 1.4.3 - AA (Contrast (Minimum)


## How we tested the NHS COVID-19 App

We're committed to regular audits of the app by independent specialist assessors.

The NHS COVID-19 App for Apple iOS and Android devices was last tested on 2 May 2020 and was checked for compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA.

The full service was tested by [Phil Sherry](https://github.com/philsherry) on 2 May 2020.
